## Introduction

Welcome to the **JavaBasics Repository**! This repository contains all the assignments from the Intro to Computer Science course, focusing on the fundamental principles of Java programming. Each assignment is meticulously designed to help you grasp essential concepts such as data types, I/O operations, loops, arrays, recursion, and object-oriented programming.

Whether you are a beginner looking to strengthen your understanding of Java or an experienced developer revisiting the basics, this repository will be a valuable resource. Let's dive into the fascinating world of Java programming through a structured and comprehensive set of assignments.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) (Version 11 or higher).
- You have installed [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) or [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).
- You have access to a terminal or command line interface.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

    Change into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd yourproject
    ```

3. **Compiling**

   Use this command to compile a single file
   ```bash
    javac filename.java
    ```
   Use this command to compile all the Java files in a folder. This is useful for when there is more than one Java file in a folder.
   ```bash
    javac FolderName/*.java
    ```
4. **Executing**

   Use the following command to execute a single file with no arguments:
   ```bash
    java filename
    ```

   Use to execute a single file within a folder with no arguments:
   ```bash
    java FolderName/filename
    ```

    **NOTE: When executing a driver file, there is no need to provide arguments when executing**
    
    Use the following command to execute a single file with arguments:
   ```bash
    java filename argument1 argument2 argumentn
    ```

   Use to execute a single file within a folder with arguments:
   ```bash
    java FolderName/filename argument1 argument2 argumentn
    ```

5. **Output**
   You could view the output in your terminal for most programs
