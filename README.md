## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) (Version 11 or higher).
- You have installed [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) or [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).
- You have access to a terminal or command line interface.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

    Change into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd yourproject
    ```

3. **Compiling**

   Use this command to compile a single file
   ```bash
    javac filename.java
    ```
   Use this command to compile all the Java files in a folder. This is useful for when there is more than one Java file in a folder.
   ```bash
    javac FolderName/*.java
    ```
4. **Executing**

   Use the following command to execute a single file with no arguments:
   ```bash
    java filename
    ```

   Use to execute a single file within a folder with no arguments:
   ```bash
    java FolderName/filename
    ```

    **NOTE: When executing a driver file, there is no need to provide arguments when executing*
    
    Use the following command to execute a single file with arguments:
   ```bash
    java filename argument1 argument2 argumentn
    ```

   Use to execute a single file within a folder with arguments:
   ```bash
    java FolderName/filename argument1 argument2 argumentn
    ```

5. **Output**
   You could view the output in your terminal for most programs
